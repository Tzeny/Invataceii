# Invataceii
This is a small project to exemplify the use of a REST API. The server will be programmed in Python 3 while the client will be programmed in Java.

Current target: read sensor data from a light sensor connected to a Raspberry PI 3, make it available via the API and have a Java client plot the data.

All client files go in the Client folder
All server files go in the Server folder
